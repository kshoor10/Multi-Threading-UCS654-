# Multi-Threading-UCS654-
Multithreading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control, enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
In my codeBy utilizing multiple threads, this approach aims to distribute the workload of matrix multiplication across multiple CPU cores, potentially reducing the overall computation time compared to performing the multiplications sequentially.
The given code explanation.
Generate Random Matrices: generate_random_matrices function generates a list of 1000 random matrices, each with a size of 1000x1000.
Perform Multiplication with Different Numbers of Threads: The code iterates over different numbers of threads from 1 to 6. For each number of threads, it performs matrix multiplication using the perform_multiplication_with_threads function and records the time taken for the operation.
Create DataFrame: The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys represent the number of threads and the values represent the time taken. This dictionary is then converted into a DataFrame using Pandas. The DataFrame is structured to have two columns: "Threads" and "Time Taken (s)". The number of threads is moved to the first column for better visualization.
Visualize DataFrame: The DataFrame is displayed to view the time taken for matrix multiplication with different numbers of threads.
Plot: Finally, a plot is generated using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between the number of threads and the time taken for matrix multiplication. The x-axis represents the number of threads, and the y-axis represents the time taken in seconds. Each point on the plot corresponds to a specific number of threads, showing how the time taken varies as the number of threads increases.
